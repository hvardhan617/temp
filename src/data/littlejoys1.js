But then I studied deeply and saw few reviews and decided to go for it. After tryin it for 2 months, I can say that its a wonderful product.. my baby loves the taste of gummies and nutrimix and he i fewl he even gained some weight which was the biggest cause of worry..

Other health drinks are filled with unhealthy amounts of processed sugar. I was so happy to find out that nutrimix is sweetened by jaggery and is made with amazing ingredients like millets. The taste is approved by my kidsüëç. I love all the products by Little Joys but I must say this combo is the best!',
